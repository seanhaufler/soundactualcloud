A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." } }, "desc" : "The Clash were an English punk rock band that formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk. Along with punk, their music incorporated elements of reggae, ska, dub, funk, rap, dance, and rockabilly. For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky \"Topper\" Headon (drums, percussion). Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones's departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.\n\nThe Clash achieved commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, The Clash, in 1977. Their third album, London Calling, released in the UK in December 1979, brought them popularity in the United States when it came out there the following month. It was declared the best album of the 1980s a decade later by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nThe Clash's politicised lyrics, musical experimentation and rebellious attitude had a far-reaching influence on rock, alternative rock in particular. They became widely referred to as \"The Only Band That Matters\", originally a promotional slogan introduced by the group's record label, CBS. In January 2003, the band—including original drummer Terry Chimes—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Clash number 28 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time." }

One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. gained early attention due to Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style and Stipe's unclear vocals. R.E.M. released its first single, \"Radio Free Europe\", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the history of popular music. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThey have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 the Beatles have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful \"Hot 100\" artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals, highlighted by The Edge's timbrally varied guitar sounds and Bono's expressive vocals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\n\nU2 formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, they became a top international act. They were more successful as live performers than they were at selling records, until their breakthrough 1987 album The Joshua Tree, which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". Reacting to musical stagnation and late-1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction, the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour. U2 integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s with mixed levels of success. U2 regained critical and commercial favour after their 2000 record All That You Can't Leave Behind.

Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas. Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara.\n\nOases are formed from underground rivers or aquifers such as an artesian aquifer, where water can reach the surface naturally by pressure or by man made wells. Occasional brief thunderstorms provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the Tuat. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds who also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis." }

The members of the Band first came together as they joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins's backing group, The Hawks, one by one between 1958 and 1963.\n\nIn 1964, they separated from Hawkins, after which they toured and released a few singles as Levon and the Hawks and the Canadian Squires. The next year, Bob Dylan hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with Dylan to Saugerties, New York, where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became The Basement Tapes, which forged the basis for their 1968 debut album Music from Big Pink. Because they were always \"the band\" to various frontmen, Helm said the name \"The Band\" worked well when the group came into its own. The group began performing officially as The Band in 1968, and went on to release ten studio albums. Dylan continued to collaborate with The Band over the course of their career, including a joint 1974 tour.\n\nThe original configuration of The Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz. The Band recommenced touring in 1983 without guitarist Robbie Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. Following a 1986 show, Richard Manuel was found dead of suicide; despite this, the remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a revolving door of musicians filling Manuel and Robertson's respective roles, before finally settling on Richard Bell, Randy Ciarlante and Jim Weider. Rick Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good. Levon Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, and after a series of treatments was able to regain use of his voice. He continued to perform and released several successful albums until he succumbed to the disease in 2012.\n\nThe group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them No.50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and in 2008, they received the Grammy's Lifetime Achievement Award.

His live performances at their best are described as transcendental, while some of his recordings, such as the studio albums Astral Weeks and Moondance and the live album It's Too Late to Stop Now, are critically acclaimed and appear at the top of many greatest album lists.\n\nKnown as \"Van the Man\" to his fans, Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands covering the popular hits of the day. He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic \"Gloria\". His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in 1967.\nAfter Berns' death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks in 1968.  Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially poorly received; however, the next one, Moondance, established Morrison as a major artist, and throughout the 1970s he built on his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968.\n\nMuch of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles \"Brown Eyed Girl\", \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\", \"Domino\" and \"Wild Night\". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as Astral Weeks and lesser-known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic Soul\".\n\nMorrison has received considerable acclaim, including six Grammy Awards, the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, being inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and appearing on several \"Greatest Artists\" lists." }

Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara.\n\nOases are formed from underground rivers or aquifers such as an artesian aquifer, where water can reach the surface naturally by pressure or by man made wells. Occasional brief thunderstorms provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the Tuat. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds who also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis." }, "The Ramones" : { "song_cover" : "http://something-gold-something-new.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Ramones1.jpg", "song_id" : 466223, "name" : "The Ramones", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Ramones", "song" : "The KKK Took My Baby Away", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/johnny-axel/quando-voc-some", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/12789020378", "song_pop" : 1301802392, "_id" : "162f95c05c67a19bb61b243a27031e23", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Ramones were an American rock band that formed in the New York City neighborhood of Forest Hills, Queens, in 1974.

A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." }, "The Black Keys" : { "song_cover" : "http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/533314_10150772509360309_1001985786_n.jpg", "song_id" : 25279554, "name" : "The Black Keys", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Black_Keys", "song" : "The Only One", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/saiofficial/progressive-trance-electro", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/8746730308", "song_pop" : 1301816014, "_id" : "d389511c7ef42897769024cc5366602b", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Black Keys is an American rock band formed in Akron, Ohio in 2001.

The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid 1960s, Brian Wilson's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Wilson-composed Pet Sounds album and \"Good Vibrations\" single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple surf rock of the Beach Boys' early years.\n\nStarting in 1967, Wilson gradually abdicated control to the rest of the band, assuming a reduced level of input due to mental-health and substance-abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical and commercial success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial and critical momentum in America despite once being seen as the primary competitors to the Beatles.

Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run.

It became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the group released a string of commercially and critically successful singles and LPs, and gained a reputation for songs and concept albums reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational writing style. The Kinks' subsequent theatrical concept albums met with less success, but the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with albums Sleepwalker, Misfits, Low Budget and State of Confusion.

Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. R.E.M. disbanded in September 2011, announcing the split on its website." }, "Deep Purple" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.k-rockcentre.com/upload/File/deep-purple-current-lineup.jpg", "song_id" : 30655577, "name" : "Deep Purple", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deep_Purple", "song" : "Purple Swag", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/boo-gotti-7/boo-gotti-good-day", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/192121640808384", "song_pop" : 1301828849, "_id" : "f04f4ffc085d2fa18347c68299d169ac", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968.

His live performances at their best are described as transcendental, while some of his recordings, such as the studio albums Astral Weeks and Moondance and the live album It's Too Late to Stop Now, are critically acclaimed and appear at the top of many greatest album lists.\n\nKnown as \"Van the Man\" to his fans, Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands covering the popular hits of the day. He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic \"Gloria\". His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in 1967.\nAfter Berns' death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks in 1968.  Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially poorly received; however, the next one, Moondance, established Morrison as a major artist, and throughout the 1970s he built on his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968.\n\nMuch of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles \"Brown Eyed Girl\", \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\", \"Domino\" and \"Wild Night\". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as Astral Weeks and lesser-known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic Soul\".\n\nMorrison has received considerable acclaim, including six Grammy Awards, the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, being inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and appearing on several \"Greatest Artists\" lists." }, "The Band" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/the-band-photo-3.jpg", "song_id" : 27385408, "name" : "The Band", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Band", "song" : "All Your Life", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/ftaudio/woman-mix-dj-fl3x-fernando", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/28815296015", "song_pop" : 1301915743, "_id" : "d289114c4f4897cb4bf9c08d1ea7ad1f", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Band was a Canadian-American roots rock group that originally consisted of Rick Danko (bass guitar, double bass, fiddle, trombone, vocals), Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, vocals), Garth Hudson (keyboard instruments, saxophones, trumpet), Richard Manuel (piano, drums, baritone saxophone, vocals) and Robbie Robertson (guitar, vocals). The members of the Band first came together as they joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins's backing group, The Hawks, one by one between 1958 and 1963.\n\nIn 1964, they separated from Hawkins, after which they toured and released a few singles as Levon and the Hawks and the Canadian Squires. The next year, Bob Dylan hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with Dylan to Saugerties, New York, where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became The Basement Tapes, which forged the basis for their 1968 debut album Music from Big Pink. Because they were always \"the band\" to various frontmen, Helm said the name \"The Band\" worked well when the group came into its own. The group began performing officially as The Band in 1968, and went on to release ten studio albums. Dylan continued to collaborate with The Band over the course of their career, including a joint 1974 tour.\n\nThe original configuration of The Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz. The Band recommenced touring in 1983 without guitarist Robbie Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. Following a 1986 show, Richard Manuel was found dead of suicide; despite this, the remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a revolving door of musicians filling Manuel and Robertson's respective roles, before finally settling on Richard Bell, Randy Ciarlante and Jim Weider. Rick Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good. Levon Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, and after a series of treatments was able to regain use of his voice. He continued to perform and released several successful albums until he succumbed to the disease in 2012.\n\nThe group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

However, the album contained two of the band's most popular tracks: \"Desperado\" and \"Tequila Sunrise\".

A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." }, "The Clash" : { "song_cover" : "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/TheClashLondonCallingalbumcover.jpg/220px-TheClashLondonCallingalbumcover.jpg", "song_id" : 29532795, "name" : "The Clash", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Clash", "song" : "(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/ftaudio/woman-mix-dj-fl3x-fernando", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/5151709484", "song_pop" : 1301303082, "_id" : "01d5bc9af49c44f42e892b28c7d3d7ea", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Clash were an English punk rock band that formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk.

The group was initially composed of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, the Beach Boys signed to Capitol Records in 1962. The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid 1960s, Brian Wilson's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Wilson-composed Pet Sounds album and \"Good Vibrations\" single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple surf rock of the Beach Boys' early years.\n\nStarting in 1967, Wilson gradually abdicated control to the rest of the band, assuming a reduced level of input due to mental-health and substance-abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical and commercial success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial and critical momentum in America despite once being seen as the primary competitors to the Beatles. Since the 1980s, there has been much legal-wrangling among the group members over royalties, songwriting credits, and use of the band's name. Following Carl Wilson's death in 1998, a number of versions of the band, each fronted by a surviving member of the original quintet (Dennis having died in 1983), continued to tour into the 2000s. In 2012, the surviving Beach Boys put aside their differences, recorded a new album, and embarked on a full-scale reunion tour.\n\nThe Beach Boys have often been called \"America's Band\", and Allmusic has stated that \"the band's unerring ability... made them America's first, best rock band.\" The group has had thirty-six United States Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band) and fifty-six Hot 100 hits, including four number-one singles.

He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 35 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\n\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and clawhammer acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic (folk and country rock) and electric (amplified hard rock, very often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\".\n\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/Déjà Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\n\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (née Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he has retained his Canadian citizenship. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada." }, "Creedence Clearwater Revival" : { "song_cover" : "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival_1968.jpg/275px-Creedence_Clearwater_Revival_1968.jpg", "song_id" : 1144053, "name" : "Creedence Clearwater Revival", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creedence_Clearwater_Revival", "song" : "Fortunate Son", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/edortza-alkon/dj-edortza", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/14246452980", "song_pop" : 1301227742, "_id" : "43d851c1621a965d1a42f24e751bbdbb", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Creedence Clearwater Revival (sometimes shortened to Creedence or CCR) was an American rock band that gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a number of successful singles drawn from various albums.\n\nThe band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother and rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford.

With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members.

Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThey have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 the Beatles have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful \"Hot 100\" artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people, the Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with EMI Records estimating sales of over one billion units." }, "Pink Floyd" : { "song_cover" : "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/252/30645749.png", "song_id" : 32865075, "name" : "Pink Floyd", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pink_Floyd", "song" : "Stairway To Heaven", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/jaysonframe/marvins-room-frame-jojo-cover", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/5660597307", "song_pop" : 1301014609, "_id" : "56ee13ff49a1f625d9f761cb6854fea6", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Pink Floyd were an English rock band that achieved international success with their progressive and psychedelic music.

The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.\n\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarising at the time of its release, is now frequently recognised as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success.

He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 35 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\n\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and clawhammer acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic (folk and country rock) and electric (amplified hard rock, very often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\".\n\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/Déjà Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\n\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (née Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he has retained his Canadian citizenship. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada." }, "Creedence Clearwater Revival" : { "song_cover" : "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival_1968.jpg/275px-Creedence_Clearwater_Revival_1968.jpg", "song_id" : 1144053, "name" : "Creedence Clearwater Revival", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creedence_Clearwater_Revival", "song" : "Fortunate Son", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/edortza-alkon/dj-edortza", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/14246452980", "song_pop" : 1301227742, "_id" : "43d851c1621a965d1a42f24e751bbdbb", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Creedence Clearwater Revival (sometimes shortened to Creedence or CCR) was an American rock band that gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a number of successful singles drawn from various albums.\n\nThe band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother and rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford.

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions.

Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members.

After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThey have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 the Beatles have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful \"Hot 100\" artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

Despite a limited mainstream exposure of four years, he is widely considered to have been the greatest electric guitarist in the history of popular music, and one of the most important musicians of the 20th century.\n\nInfluenced musically by American rock and roll and electric blues, following his initial success in Europe with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, he achieved fame in the US after his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, before dying from drug-related asphyxia at the age of 27.\n\nInstrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain. He helped to popularize the use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock, which he often used to deliver tonal exaggerations in his solos. He also pioneered experimentation with stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings.\n\nThe recipient of several prestigious rock music awards during his lifetime and posthumously, the Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. English Heritage erected a blue plaque to identify his former residence on Brook Street, London, in September 1997. Rolling Stone ranked his three non-posthumous studio albums, Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland among the 100 greatest of all time; they ranked Hendrix the number one greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist." }

R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success.

In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968.\n\nMuch of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles \"Brown Eyed Girl\", \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\", \"Domino\" and \"Wild Night\". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as Astral Weeks and lesser-known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic Soul\".\n\nMorrison has received considerable acclaim, including six Grammy Awards, the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, being inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and appearing on several \"Greatest Artists\" lists." }, "David Bowie" : { "song_cover" : "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NTE3MTYzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4OTcyMg%40%40._V1._SY314_CR6,0,214,314_.jpg", "song_id" : 3246919, "name" : "David Bowie", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Bowie", "song" : "Major Tom", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/zionhighrecords/for-your-love-siick-feat", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/30899502664", "song_pop" : 1301812645, "_id" : "d1059f2a65fc93289869aeb988a6d849", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "David Robert Jones (born 8 January 1947), known by his stage name David Bowie ( ), is an English musician, actor, record producer and arranger. A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." }, "The Velvet Underground" : { "song_cover" : "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/224914/The%2BVelvet%2BUnderground.jpg", "song_id" : 179037, "name" : "The Velvet Underground", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Velvet_Underground", "song" : "Sunday Morning", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/lirikal_braid_undergrouns/3-graffiti-es-lo-que-vivo-eds", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/225538844176185", "song_pop" : 1301204723, "_id" : "a407e96b22dac9af6725ed5e4d54cf0b", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Velvet Underground was an American rock band formed in New York City.

The members of the Band first came together as they joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins's backing group, The Hawks, one by one between 1958 and 1963.\n\nIn 1964, they separated from Hawkins, after which they toured and released a few singles as Levon and the Hawks and the Canadian Squires. The next year, Bob Dylan hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with Dylan to Saugerties, New York, where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became The Basement Tapes, which forged the basis for their 1968 debut album Music from Big Pink. Because they were always \"the band\" to various frontmen, Helm said the name \"The Band\" worked well when the group came into its own. The group began performing officially as The Band in 1968, and went on to release ten studio albums. Dylan continued to collaborate with The Band over the course of their career, including a joint 1974 tour.\n\nThe original configuration of The Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz. The Band recommenced touring in 1983 without guitarist Robbie Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. Following a 1986 show, Richard Manuel was found dead of suicide; despite this, the remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a revolving door of musicians filling Manuel and Robertson's respective roles, before finally settling on Richard Bell, Randy Ciarlante and Jim Weider. Rick Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good.

He has worked as a composer for movies and musical plays and has acted in supporting roles in films including Paradise Alley and Bram Stoker's Dracula; he also starred in the 1986 film Down by Law. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his soundtrack work on One from the Heart.\n\nLyrically, Waits' songs frequently present atmospheric portrayals of grotesque, often seedy characters and places—although he has also shown a penchant for more conventional ballads. He has a cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters despite having little radio or music video support. His songs are best-known through cover versions by more commercial artists: \"Jersey Girl\", performed by Bruce Springsteen, \"Ol' '55\", performed by the Eagles, and \"Downtown Train\", performed by Rod Stewart. Although Waits' albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native United States, they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries. He has been nominated for a number of major music awards and has won Grammy Awards for two albums, Bone Machine and Mule Variations.

They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions.

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". Similarly, the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated that the band were \"as influential in that decade 1970s as the Beatles were in the prior one\"." }, "Pink Floyd" : { "song_cover" : "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/252/30645749.png", "song_id" : 32865075, "name" : "Pink Floyd", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pink_Floyd", "song" : "Stairway To Heaven", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/jaysonframe/marvins-room-frame-jojo-cover", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/5660597307", "song_pop" : 1301014609, "_id" : "56ee13ff49a1f625d9f761cb6854fea6", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Pink Floyd were an English rock band that achieved international success with their progressive and psychedelic music.

They first gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's creative leadership they released two charting singles and a successful debut album. David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967, and Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to his deteriorating mental health. After Barrett's departure, Waters became their primary songwriter and lyricist. With Waters, Mason, Wright and Gilmour, Pink Floyd achieved critical and commercial success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979).\n\nWright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985.

A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." }, "Queen" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTQ%2520Landing%2520Page%2520Burnley.jpg", "song_id" : 25183178, "name" : "Queen", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queen", "song" : "I Want to Break Free", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/xexsnowblindxex/for-lina", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/17337462361", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "2c2d2c0291163b077a372c2a9c5a6eda", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Queen may refer to:" }, "Red Hot Chili Peppers" : { "song_cover" : "http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28300000/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-red-hot-chili-peppers-28350331-1024-768.jpg", "song_id" : 25607704, "name" : "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers", "song" : "Can't Stop", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/xexsnowblindxex/for-lina", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/8335563918", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "8780f1b8319cd5a65180ce25a0fd4f73", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

U2 integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image.

Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.\n\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarising at the time of its release, is now frequently recognised as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.\n\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists,  they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stones list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers.  In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s." } }, "desc" : "R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and drummer Bill Berry. One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. gained early attention due to Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style and Stipe's unclear vocals. R.E.M. released its first single, \"Radio Free Europe\", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. R.E.M. disbanded in September 2011, announcing the split on its website." }

He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 35 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\n\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and clawhammer acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic (folk and country rock) and electric (amplified hard rock, very often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\".\n\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/Déjà Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\n\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (née Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he has retained his Canadian citizenship. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada." }, "Creedence Clearwater Revival" : { "song_cover" : "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival_1968.jpg/275px-Creedence_Clearwater_Revival_1968.jpg", "song_id" : 1144053, "name" : "Creedence Clearwater Revival", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creedence_Clearwater_Revival", "song" : "Fortunate Son", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/edortza-alkon/dj-edortza", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/14246452980", "song_pop" : 1301227742, "_id" : "43d851c1621a965d1a42f24e751bbdbb", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Creedence Clearwater Revival (sometimes shortened to Creedence or CCR) was an American rock band that gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a number of successful singles drawn from various albums.\n\nThe band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother and rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford.

They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London.

The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart.

The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001.

He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 35 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\n\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and clawhammer acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic (folk and country rock) and electric (amplified hard rock, very often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\".\n\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/Déjà Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\n\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (née Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he has retained his Canadian citizenship. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada." }, "The Rolling Stones" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/images_songs/rs-1stones.jpg", "song_id" : 7464375, "name" : "The Rolling Stones", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Rolling_Stones", "song" : "Sympathy for the Devil", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/8305888286", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "0e2bad2ca7080a03a628963bb3d403cd", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962.

They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot.

The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame.

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". Similarly, the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated that the band were \"as influential in that decade 1970s as the Beatles were in the prior one\"." }, "Queen" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTQ%2520Landing%2520Page%2520Burnley.jpg", "song_id" : 25183178, "name" : "Queen", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queen", "song" : "I Want to Break Free", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/xexsnowblindxex/for-lina", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/17337462361", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "2c2d2c0291163b077a372c2a9c5a6eda", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Queen may refer to:" }, "Red Hot Chili Peppers" : { "song_cover" : "http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28300000/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-red-hot-chili-peppers-28350331-1024-768.jpg", "song_id" : 25607704, "name" : "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers", "song" : "Can't Stop", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/xexsnowblindxex/for-lina", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/8335563918", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "8780f1b8319cd5a65180ce25a0fd4f73", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market.

Since Wyman's retirement in 1993, the band's full members have been Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood who joined in 1975, replacing Mick Taylor (who followed Jones). Jones founded and led the band, but Jagger and Richards assumed leadership after becoming the band's primary songwriters, as Jones' physical and mental troubles  gradually incapacitated him prior to his drowning death in 1969. Longtime regular bassist  Darryl Jones and keyboardist Chuck Leavell are not full band members. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the Rolling Stones in 1989, noting that \"critical acclaim and popular consensus has accorded them the title of the “World’s Greatest Rock and Roll Band.”\n\nThe Rolling Stones were popular in Europe and then became successful in North America during the mid-1960s British Invasion. They have released twenty-two studio albums in the United Kingdom (24 in the United States), eleven live albums (ten in the US), and numerous compilations.\n\nThe Rolling Stones' advent brought greater international recognition to the primitive urban blues typified by Chess Records' artists such as Muddy Waters, writer of \"Rollin' Stone\", the song for which the band is named. Critic and musicologist Robert Palmer said their endurance and relevance stems from being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\" while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\".

The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001.

Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals, highlighted by The Edge's timbrally varied guitar sounds and Bono's expressive vocals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\n\nU2 formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, they became a top international act. They were more successful as live performers than they were at selling records, until their breakthrough 1987 album The Joshua Tree, which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". Reacting to musical stagnation and late-1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction, the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour. U2 integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image.

A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." }, "Bruce Springsteen" : { "song_cover" : "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/artist/timeline/400x600/20121011-bruce-springsteen-1984-600x400-1350510472.jpg", "song_id" : 8345684, "name" : "Bruce Springsteen", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Springsteen", "song" : "Born in the USA", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/zuriosterholt/chico-clouds", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/7401700249", "song_pop" : 1301314688, "_id" : "fcbb413e600dfc8741df9c6cecfb7ede", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949), nicknamed \"The Boss\", is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who records and tours with the E Street Band.

R.E.M. released its first single, \"Radio Free Europe\", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S.

In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success.

The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the history of popular music. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThey have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 the Beatles have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful \"Hot 100\" artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals, highlighted by The Edge's timbrally varied guitar sounds and Bono's expressive vocals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\n\nU2 formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, they became a top international act. They were more successful as live performers than they were at selling records, until their breakthrough 1987 album The Joshua Tree, which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". Reacting to musical stagnation and late-1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction, the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour. U2 integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image.

Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas. Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara.\n\nOases are formed from underground rivers or aquifers such as an artesian aquifer, where water can reach the surface naturally by pressure or by man made wells. Occasional brief thunderstorms provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the Tuat. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds who also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis." }, "Bob Marley" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.biography.com/imported/images/Biography/Images/Profiles/M/Bob-Marley-9399524-5-402.jpg", "song_id" : 29581414, "name" : "Bob Marley", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Marley", "song" : "Three Little Birds", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/elegant-pumpkin/malevolent-volture-elegant", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/117533210756", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "e7646f6929cc4da16ba5ce14b2488830", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Nesta Robert Marley, OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981), more widely and commonly known as Bob Marley, was a Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician.

Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie and military police are military units charged with civil policing.\n\nLaw enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property. Some parts of the world may suffer from police corruption.\n\nAlternative names for police force include constabulary, gendarmerie, police department, police service, crime prevention, protective services, law enforcement agency, civil guard or civic guard. Members may be referred to as police officers, troopers, sheriffs, constables, rangers, peace officers or civic/civil guards. Police of the Soviet-era Eastern Europe were (or are, in some cases, as in Belarus) called the militsiya. The Irish police are called the Garda Síochána (\"guardians of the peace\"); a police officer is called a garda. As police are often in conflict with individuals, slang terms are numerous. Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymology." }

A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." }, "Red Hot Chili Peppers" : { "song_cover" : "http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28300000/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-red-hot-chili-peppers-28350331-1024-768.jpg", "song_id" : 25607704, "name" : "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers", "song" : "Can't Stop", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/xexsnowblindxex/for-lina", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/8335563918", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "8780f1b8319cd5a65180ce25a0fd4f73", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

Their fame grew with memorable performances at the Monterey Pop, Woodstock the display describes them as \"Prime contenders, in the minds of many, for the title of World's Greatest Rock Band.\" TIME magazine wrote in 1979 that \"No other group has ever pushed rock so far, or asked so much from it.\" Rolling Stone magazine wrote: \"Along with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, The Who complete the holy trinity of British rock.\" They received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988 and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001, for creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording. In 2008 surviving members Townshend and Daltrey were honoured at the 31st Annual Kennedy Center Honors. That same year VH1 Rock Honors paid tribute to The Who where Jack Black of Tenacious D called them \"the greatest band of all time.\"" }

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". Similarly, the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated that the band were \"as influential in that decade 1970s as the Beatles were in the prior one\"." }, "Queen" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTQ%2520Landing%2520Page%2520Burnley.jpg", "song_id" : 25183178, "name" : "Queen", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queen", "song" : "I Want to Break Free", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/xexsnowblindxex/for-lina", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/17337462361", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "2c2d2c0291163b077a372c2a9c5a6eda", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Queen may refer to:" }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the history of popular music. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThey have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 the Beatles have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful \"Hot 100\" artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

U2's early sound was rooted in post-punk but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals, highlighted by The Edge's timbrally varied guitar sounds and Bono's expressive vocals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\n\nU2 formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, they became a top international act. They were more successful as live performers than they were at selling records, until their breakthrough 1987 album The Joshua Tree, which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". Reacting to musical stagnation and late-1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction, the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour. U2 integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s with mixed levels of success. U2 regained critical and commercial favour after their 2000 record All That You Can't Leave Behind. On it and the group's subsequent releases, they adopted a more conventional sound while maintaining influences from their earlier musical explorations.\n\nU2 have released 12 studio albums and are among the all-time best-selling music artists, having sold more than 150million records worldwide.

The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }

Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara.\n\nOases are formed from underground rivers or aquifers such as an artesian aquifer, where water can reach the surface naturally by pressure or by man made wells. Occasional brief thunderstorms provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the Tuat. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds who also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis." }, "The White Stripes" : { "song_cover" : "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Meg_%2526_Jack,_The_White_Stripes.jpg", "song_id" : 23116555, "name" : "The White Stripes", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_White_Stripes", "song" : "Jimmy the Exploder", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/crowley6/miss-atomic-bomb", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/383897895041", "song_pop" : 1301305151, "_id" : "5eed7358bd6af964a697a1172feea74c", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The White Stripes was an American rock duo, formed in 1997 in Detroit, Michigan.

Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with a total of nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band's albums at the time peaking in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album, Because of the Times, also reached the No.1 spot. After the release of Only by the Night in September 2008 the band achieved chart success in the United States.

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". Similarly, the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated that the band were \"as influential in that decade 1970s as the Beatles were in the prior one\"." }, "Queen" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTQ%2520Landing%2520Page%2520Burnley.jpg", "song_id" : 25183178, "name" : "Queen", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queen", "song" : "I Want to Break Free", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/xexsnowblindxex/for-lina", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/17337462361", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "2c2d2c0291163b077a372c2a9c5a6eda", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Queen may refer to:" }, "Red Hot Chili Peppers" : { "song_cover" : "http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28300000/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-red-hot-chili-peppers-28350331-1024-768.jpg", "song_id" : 25607704, "name" : "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers", "song" : "Can't Stop", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/xexsnowblindxex/for-lina", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/8335563918", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "8780f1b8319cd5a65180ce25a0fd4f73", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "Aerosmith" : { "song_cover" : "http://tec-direct.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07-aerosmith-082707.jpg", "song_id" : 25519666, "name" : "Aerosmith", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aerosmith", "song" : "Crazy", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/xexsnowblindxex/for-lina", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/58153618123", "song_pop" : 1301841426, "_id" : "57bab982bcba3e65c33206f442a015db", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as \"The Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band.\" Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with singer Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston.\n\nThey were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of multi-platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by their 1974 album Get Your Wings.

By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which resulted in the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date.

He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic \"Gloria\". His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in 1967.\nAfter Berns' death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks in 1968.  Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially poorly received; however, the next one, Moondance, established Morrison as a major artist, and throughout the 1970s he built on his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968.\n\nMuch of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles \"Brown Eyed Girl\", \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\", \"Domino\" and \"Wild Night\". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as Astral Weeks and lesser-known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic Soul\".\n\nMorrison has received considerable acclaim, including six Grammy Awards, the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, being inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and appearing on several \"Greatest Artists\" lists." }, "Grateful Dead" : { "song_cover" : "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1c/LightningBoltSkull.gif/250px-LightningBoltSkull.gif", "song_id" : 330032, "name" : "Grateful Dead", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grateful_Dead", "song" : "Ripple", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/lirikal_braid_undergrouns/3-graffiti-es-lo-que-vivo-eds", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/6394861658", "song_pop" : 1301301306, "_id" : "f4e73f61a7302f087edde07778da8903", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Grateful Dead were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California.

After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until finally disbanding in 1973.\n\nThey were signed to Elektra Records in 1966.

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". Similarly, the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated that the band were \"as influential in that decade 1970s as the Beatles were in the prior one\"." }, "R.E.M." : { "song_cover" : "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/293124/REM.jpg", "song_id" : 7275342, "name" : "R.E.M.", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=R.E.M.", "song" : "Losing My Religion", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/djmikeypee/p-nk-try-mikey-pee-remix", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/174543792339", "song_pop" : 1301699999, "_id" : "34caf65800d4f1d7b4ca594003f950bc", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and drummer Bill Berry.

Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros.

R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio.

Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThey have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act.

Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\n\nU2 formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, they became a top international act. They were more successful as live performers than they were at selling records, until their breakthrough 1987 album The Joshua Tree, which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". Reacting to musical stagnation and late-1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction, the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour. U2 integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s with mixed levels of success. U2 regained critical and commercial favour after their 2000 record All That You Can't Leave Behind.

Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "Oasis" : { "song_cover" : "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/MiddleSpring.JPG/220px-MiddleSpring.JPG", "song_id" : 22626424, "name" : "Oasis", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oasis", "song" : "Oasis", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/lirikal_braid_undergrouns/3-graffiti-es-lo-que-vivo-eds", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/9949696967", "song_pop" : 1301200641, "_id" : "0454236a66b299894fc9ee3f5e8fc6b6", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "In geography, an oasis (plural: oases) or cienega (Southwestern United States) is an isolated area of vegetation in a desert, typically surrounding a spring or similar water source. Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas. Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara.\n\nOases are formed from underground rivers or aquifers such as an artesian aquifer, where water can reach the surface naturally by pressure or by man made wells. Occasional brief thunderstorms provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the Tuat. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds who also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis." }, "Guns'N'Roses" : { "song_cover" : "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/500/150774/Guns%2BN%2BRoses.jpg", "song_id" : 29364698, "name" : "Guns'N'Roses", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Guns'N'Roses", "song" : "Knockin´on heavens door", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/dielan-2/dielan-drown-it", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/10901008068", "song_pop" : 1301300907, "_id" : "4e9bff0dfcc305e95260434a245f283c", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band who formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1985.

The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001.

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". Similarly, the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated that the band were \"as influential in that decade 1970s as the Beatles were in the prior one\"." }

A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." }, "The Kinks" : { "song_cover" : "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/295886/The%2BKinks.jpg", "song_id" : 108761, "name" : "The Kinks", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Kinks", "song" : "Sunny Afternoon", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/saiofficial/progressive-trance-electro", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/133206500059423", "song_pop" : 1301810901, "_id" : "f7c127bbb43f5a03bcfb175405a41407", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Ray and Dave Davies in 1964.

Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run. Original members Pete Quaife (bass guitar, vocals) and Mick Avory (drums and percussion) were replaced by John Dalton in 1969 and Bob Henrit in 1984, respectively. Dalton was in turn replaced by Jim Rodford in 1978. Keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band during studio sessions in the mid-1960s. Later, various keyboardists, including John Gosling and Ian Gibbons, were full-time members. It became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the group released a string of commercially and critically successful singles and LPs, and gained a reputation for songs and concept albums reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational writing style. The Kinks' subsequent theatrical concept albums met with less success, but the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with albums Sleepwalker, Misfits, Low Budget and State of Confusion. Also groups such as  Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack and the Pretenders covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence.\n\nThe Kinks had five Top 10 singles on the US Billboard chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40.

The term is most commonly associated with police services of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie and military police are military units charged with civil policing.\n\nLaw enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property. Some parts of the world may suffer from police corruption.\n\nAlternative names for police force include constabulary, gendarmerie, police department, police service, crime prevention, protective services, law enforcement agency, civil guard or civic guard. Members may be referred to as police officers, troopers, sheriffs, constables, rangers, peace officers or civic/civil guards. Police of the Soviet-era Eastern Europe were (or are, in some cases, as in Belarus) called the militsiya.

One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. gained early attention due to Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style and Stipe's unclear vocals. R.E.M. released its first single, \"Radio Free Europe\", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists. The Chili Peppers ranked # 128 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.\n\nBecause of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThey have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 the Beatles have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful \"Hot 100\" artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals, highlighted by The Edge's timbrally varied guitar sounds and Bono's expressive vocals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\n\nU2 formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, they became a top international act. They were more successful as live performers than they were at selling records, until their breakthrough 1987 album The Joshua Tree, which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". Reacting to musical stagnation and late-1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction, the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour. U2 integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s with mixed levels of success. U2 regained critical and commercial favour after their 2000 record All That You Can't Leave Behind.

Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas. Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara.\n\nOases are formed from underground rivers or aquifers such as an artesian aquifer, where water can reach the surface naturally by pressure or by man made wells. Occasional brief thunderstorms provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the Tuat. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds who also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis." }, "Radiohead" : { "song_cover" : "http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/music/Radiohead_Thom.jpg", "song_id" : 3895969, "name" : "Radiohead", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Radiohead", "song" : "All I Need", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/s-t-a-1/whales-goove-pre-mixxx", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/171808552940946", "song_pop" : 1301999999, "_id" : "16a968cdb906137a952161789b5c1ea3", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985.

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\".

Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969).

He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 35 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\n\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and clawhammer acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic (folk and country rock) and electric (amplified hard rock, very often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\".\n\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/Déjà Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\n\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (née Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he has retained his Canadian citizenship. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada." }

Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run.

The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid 1960s, Brian Wilson's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Wilson-composed Pet Sounds album and \"Good Vibrations\" single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple surf rock of the Beach Boys' early years.\n\nStarting in 1967, Wilson gradually abdicated control to the rest of the band, assuming a reduced level of input due to mental-health and substance-abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical and commercial success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial and critical momentum in America despite once being seen as the primary competitors to the Beatles. Since the 1980s, there has been much legal-wrangling among the group members over royalties, songwriting credits, and use of the band's name.

At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) and Hotel California, ranked among the 20 best-selling albums in the U.S. according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Hotel California is ranked 37th in Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and the band was ranked No.75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nThey have sold over 120 million albums worldwide—100 million in the U.S. alone—including 42 million copies of Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975). They are the fifth-highest-selling music act and highest-selling American band in U.S. history. No American band sold more records than the Eagles during the 1970s.\n\nThe Eagles released their self-titled debut album in 1972, which spawned three Top 40 singles: \"Take It Easy\", \"Witchy Woman\", and \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\". Their next album, Desperado (1973), was less successful than the first, reaching only No.41 on the charts; neither of its singles reached the Top 40. However, the album contained two of the band's most popular tracks: \"Desperado\" and \"Tequila Sunrise\". They released On the Border in 1974, adding guitarist Don Felder midway through the recording of the album. The album generated two Top 40 singles: \"Already Gone\" and their first Number One, \"Best of My Love\".\n\nIt was not until 1975's One of These Nights that the Eagles became America's biggest band. The album included three Top 10 singles: \"One of These Nights\", \"Lyin' Eyes\", and \"Take It to the Limit\". They continued that success in late 1976 with the release of Hotel California, which would go on to sell over 16 million copies in the U.S. alone. The album yielded three Top 20 singles, \"New Kid in Town\", \"Hotel California\", and \"Life in the Fast Lane\". They released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with The Long Run, which spawned three Top 10 singles: \"Heartache Tonight\", \"The Long Run\", and \"I Can't Tell You Why\".\n\nThe Eagles disbanded in July 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album Hell Freezes Over, a mix of live and new studio tracks. They have toured intermittently since then and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2007, the Eagles released Long Road Out of Eden, their first full studio album in 28 years. The album would top the album charts, release five singles to the Adult Contemporary Charts, and win the band two Grammys. The next year they launched the Long Road Out of Eden Tour in support of the album. The band members have discussed the possibility of making another album." }

He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 35 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\n\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and clawhammer acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic (folk and country rock) and electric (amplified hard rock, very often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\".\n\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/Déjà Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\n\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (née Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he has retained his Canadian citizenship. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada." }, "The Rolling Stones" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/images_songs/rs-1stones.jpg", "song_id" : 7464375, "name" : "The Rolling Stones", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Rolling_Stones", "song" : "Sympathy for the Devil", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/8305888286", "song_pop" : 1301399999, "_id" : "0e2bad2ca7080a03a628963bb3d403cd", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962.

They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London.

With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\".

A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." }

The members of the Band first came together as they joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins's backing group, The Hawks, one by one between 1958 and 1963.\n\nIn 1964, they separated from Hawkins, after which they toured and released a few singles as Levon and the Hawks and the Canadian Squires. The next year, Bob Dylan hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with Dylan to Saugerties, New York, where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became The Basement Tapes, which forged the basis for their 1968 debut album Music from Big Pink. Because they were always \"the band\" to various frontmen, Helm said the name \"The Band\" worked well when the group came into its own. The group began performing officially as The Band in 1968, and went on to release ten studio albums. Dylan continued to collaborate with The Band over the course of their career, including a joint 1974 tour.\n\nThe original configuration of The Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz. The Band recommenced touring in 1983 without guitarist Robbie Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. Following a 1986 show, Richard Manuel was found dead of suicide; despite this, the remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a revolving door of musicians filling Manuel and Robertson's respective roles, before finally settling on Richard Bell, Randy Ciarlante and Jim Weider. Rick Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good. Levon Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, and after a series of treatments was able to regain use of his voice. He continued to perform and released several successful albums until he succumbed to the disease in 2012.\n\nThe group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them No.50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and in 2008, they received the Grammy's Lifetime Achievement Award.

Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through near-constant touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and extensive licensing of their songs. Their third album, Rubber Factory (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band's profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label Nonesuch Records in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo completed Attack & Release (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer Danger Mouse, a frequent collaborator with the band.

They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London.

With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States.

They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the history of popular music. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon died in 1980 after having been shot by a deranged former fan, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThey have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 the Beatles have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful \"Hot 100\" artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" has been described as radically altering the parameters of popular music in 1965. His recordings employing electric instruments attracted denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.\n\nDylan's lyrics have incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performance style of Little Richard, and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.

Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with Dylan to Saugerties, New York, where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became The Basement Tapes, which forged the basis for their 1968 debut album Music from Big Pink. Because they were always \"the band\" to various frontmen, Helm said the name \"The Band\" worked well when the group came into its own. The group began performing officially as The Band in 1968, and went on to release ten studio albums. Dylan continued to collaborate with The Band over the course of their career, including a joint 1974 tour.\n\nThe original configuration of The Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz. The Band recommenced touring in 1983 without guitarist Robbie Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. Following a 1986 show, Richard Manuel was found dead of suicide; despite this, the remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a revolving door of musicians filling Manuel and Robertson's respective roles, before finally settling on Richard Bell, Randy Ciarlante and Jim Weider. Rick Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good.

In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called \"separators\". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets.\n\nCream skimmed from milk may be called \"sweet cream\" to distinguish it from whey cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and \"cheesy\".\n\nCream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; this gives the cream a slight yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color, cream.

Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success.

Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." } }, "desc" : "Nesta Robert Marley, OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981), more widely and commonly known as Bob Marley, was a Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician.

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States.

They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members.

The next year, Bob Dylan hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with Dylan to Saugerties, New York, where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became The Basement Tapes, which forged the basis for their 1968 debut album Music from Big Pink. Because they were always \"the band\" to various frontmen, Helm said the name \"The Band\" worked well when the group came into its own. The group began performing officially as The Band in 1968, and went on to release ten studio albums. Dylan continued to collaborate with The Band over the course of their career, including a joint 1974 tour.\n\nThe original configuration of The Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz. The Band recommenced touring in 1983 without guitarist Robbie Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. Following a 1986 show, Richard Manuel was found dead of suicide; despite this, the remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a revolving door of musicians filling Manuel and Robertson's respective roles, before finally settling on Richard Bell, Randy Ciarlante and Jim Weider. Rick Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good. Levon Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, and after a series of treatments was able to regain use of his voice. He continued to perform and released several successful albums until he succumbed to the disease in 2012.\n\nThe group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

A major figure for over four decades in the world of popular music, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and considerable eclecticism of his work.\n\nBowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song \"Space Oddity\" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"Starman\" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\" The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as \"plastic soul\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)—the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years. The so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle. He has not toured since the 2003–04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Bowie would be releasing his 30th studio recording—and first in ten years—entitled The Next Day, to be released in March 2013.\n\nBuckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\" In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140million albums. In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time." }, "The Clash" : { "song_cover" : "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/TheClashLondonCallingalbumcover.jpg/220px-TheClashLondonCallingalbumcover.jpg", "song_id" : 29532795, "name" : "The Clash", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Clash", "song" : "(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/ftaudio/woman-mix-dj-fl3x-fernando", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/5151709484", "song_pop" : 1301303082, "_id" : "01d5bc9af49c44f42e892b28c7d3d7ea", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Clash were an English punk rock band that formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk.

Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones's departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.\n\nThe Clash achieved commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, The Clash, in 1977. Their third album, London Calling, released in the UK in December 1979, brought them popularity in the United States when it came out there the following month. It was declared the best album of the 1980s a decade later by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nThe Clash's politicised lyrics, musical experimentation and rebellious attitude had a far-reaching influence on rock, alternative rock in particular. They became widely referred to as \"The Only Band That Matters\", originally a promotional slogan introduced by the group's record label, CBS. In January 2003, the band—including original drummer Terry Chimes—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Categorised in the United States as a British Invasion band, the Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run. Original members Pete Quaife (bass guitar, vocals) and Mick Avory (drums and percussion) were replaced by John Dalton in 1969 and Bob Henrit in 1984, respectively. Dalton was in turn replaced by Jim Rodford in 1978. Keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band during studio sessions in the mid-1960s. Later, various keyboardists, including John Gosling and Ian Gibbons, were full-time members. It became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the group released a string of commercially and critically successful singles and LPs, and gained a reputation for songs and concept albums reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational writing style. The Kinks' subsequent theatrical concept albums met with less success, but the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with albums Sleepwalker, Misfits, Low Budget and State of Confusion. Also groups such as  Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack and the Pretenders covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence.\n\nThe Kinks had five Top 10 singles on the US Billboard chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. Four of their albums have been certified gold by the RIAA. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Service to British Music\". In 1990, their first year of eligibility, the original four members of The Kinks were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005." }

Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals, highlighted by The Edge's timbrally varied guitar sounds and Bono's expressive vocals.

Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, they became a top international act. They were more successful as live performers than they were at selling records, until their breakthrough 1987 album The Joshua Tree, which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". Reacting to musical stagnation and late-1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction, the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour. U2 integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s with mixed levels of success. U2 regained critical and commercial favour after their 2000 record All That You Can't Leave Behind.

Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas. Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara.\n\nOases are formed from underground rivers or aquifers such as an artesian aquifer, where water can reach the surface naturally by pressure or by man made wells. Occasional brief thunderstorms provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the Tuat. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds who also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis." }, "Pink Floyd" : { "song_cover" : "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/252/30645749.png", "song_id" : 32865075, "name" : "Pink Floyd", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pink_Floyd", "song" : "Stairway To Heaven", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/jaysonframe/marvins-room-frame-jojo-cover", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/5660597307", "song_pop" : 1301014609, "_id" : "56ee13ff49a1f625d9f761cb6854fea6", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Pink Floyd were an English rock band that achieved international success with their progressive and psychedelic music.

While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic (folk and country rock) and electric (amplified hard rock, very often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\".\n\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/Déjà Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\n\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (née Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he has retained his Canadian citizenship. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada." }, "Kings Of Leon" : { "song_cover" : "http://videokeman.com/image/pics/KingsOfLeonsongPics1BDQxWX0zyAuBVM.jpg", "song_id" : 27068026, "name" : "Kings Of Leon", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kings_Of_Leon", "song" : "Radioactive", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/johnny-axel/quando-voc-some", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/6174621106", "song_pop" : 1301899999, "_id" : "87b6e6e203bfabd6f6d297d50cff8bdb", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "Kings of Leon is a Grammy winning American rock band that originated in Talihina, Oklahoma but formed in Nashville, Tennessee  in 1999.

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nOn hearing of the new group, The Who's drummer Keith Moon commented jokingly that it would \"go down like a lead balloon\". With a slightly different spelling and wording, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Prior to releasing their first album, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. They disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as indivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently recognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's unexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been involved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007, 27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live Act\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300million albums worldwide. With 111.5million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the '70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". Similarly, the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated that the band were \"as influential in that decade 1970s as the Beatles were in the prior one\"." }, "Jimi Hendrix" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.biography.com/imported/images/Biography/Images/Galleries/Jimi%2520Hendrix/hendrix_thumb.jpg", "song_id" : 8076063, "name" : "Jimi Hendrix", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimi_Hendrix", "song" : "All Along the Watchtower", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/javel/q4gsjmtgmnkb", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/38858586087", "song_pop" : 1301899999, "_id" : "24267f30f53aebb326d44f3d71b2f7cf", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "James Marshall Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American musician, singer and songwriter.

Later, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, before dying from drug-related asphyxia at the age of 27.\n\nInstrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain. He helped to popularize the use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock, which he often used to deliver tonal exaggerations in his solos. He also pioneered experimentation with stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings.\n\nThe recipient of several prestigious rock music awards during his lifetime and posthumously, the Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.

R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound.

The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock.

Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million albums worldwide. Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in drummer Irons' departure. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the album tour.\n\nAfter recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro left the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, I'm with You, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries." }, "The Beatles" : { "song_cover" : "http://www.allaboutjazz.com//media/large/5/0/b/025231aa9503922f810c3d1f9dbeb.jpg", "song_id" : 29709045, "name" : "The Beatles", "wiki_url" : "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles", "song" : "Here Comes the Sun", "sc_url" : "http://soundcloud.com/gaebr-l-y-ae-y-uraga/la-huarachita-del-tren-2013", "fb_page" : "http://www.facebook.com/69116329538", "song_pop" : 1301915721, "_id" : "c9e770c62114ed60fd1a4c6dd866e2d8", "peers" : {}, "desc" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market.

Reacting to musical stagnation and late-1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction, the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour. U2 integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image.

However, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"\n\nTo date, the band has sold over 31.5 million records in the U.S, and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to Pearl Jam as \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s.\"" }
